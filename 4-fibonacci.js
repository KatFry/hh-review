/* 
Returns the nth fibonacci number. 
A fibonacci sequence is a list of numbers that begin with 0 and 1,
and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. 

nthFibonacci(0); -> 0
 * nthFibonacci(1); -> 1
 * nthFibonacci(2); -> 1
 * nthFibonacci(3); -> 2
 * nthFibonacci(4); -> 3
 * Try to use recursion. What is the time complexity? Are you 
 * repeating the same function call with the same arguments 
 * frequently? Are you able to compute nthFibonacci(1000)? If not, 
 * recursive algorithms can be made MUCH more efficient 
 * using memoization. Try memoizing each result from nthFibonacci 
 * and see the performance difference.
