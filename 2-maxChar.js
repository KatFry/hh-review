/* Given a string, return the character that has the maximum frequency.
If multiple characters occur the max number of times, return the character that occurs first. 

Example:
maxChar('good morning') -> 'o'
maxChar('abbcc') -> 'b'
*/

// input: string
// output: string
const maxChar = char => {
  // edge case - if the passed-in char isn't a string, return 'parameter must be a string'
  
  // declare a const count initialized to an empty object

  // loop over the passed in string

    // if the char doesn't exist as a key in obj, add it, assigning it to 1 

    // if it does exist, increment it 

    // check to see the index if there are duplicates

  // return the value associated with the maxChar from the obj
